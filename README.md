# kattis
This is a repository containing all of my solutions to the problems I've completed in Kattis.

## Project Directory Guide
Each folder denotes a level of difficulty specified in Kattis. Each folder has Python files with that corresponding level of difficulty, with each file named after the ID of a Kattis problem.

## Project Notes:
1. This is an ongoing project so I'll be constantly updating this repository when I've answered more problems.
